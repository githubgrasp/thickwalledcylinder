# thickwalledcylinder
This repository contains an extended version of our MATLAB code for thick-walled cylinders, which was used for producing the results in the publication

1. Effect of creep on corrosion-induced cracking, I Aldellaa, P Havlásek, M Jirásek, P Grassl, Engineering Fracture Mechanics 264, April 2022 108310. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engfracmech.2022.108310

It is based on earlier versions of the code which were used in three other papers
